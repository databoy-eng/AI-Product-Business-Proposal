## Overview
Electroluminescence (EI) imagingisa practical methodusedto inpectdefective solarcellsin the photovoltaic(PV) modules. The EI imagin process provides ahighspatial resolutin providing thecapacity of detecting up to the finest surface module defects. However the EI image process i susually a tiime-consuming manual and expensive process In additin, the processdetecting thevarious typesof defects requires expert knowledge.

The aim of this study is to provide samples of more feasible methods using two approaches for automatic detectin of cell defects on PV modules in an individual image of a solar cell. The hardware requirements are for each approach depending on the applicatin usage. The less demanding hardware approach is rooted on manual generated features that are classified in a Support Vector Machine (SVM). An end to end stronger executin requires themore hardware demanding Convolutinal Neural Networks (CNN) runnin on a Graphics ProcessingUNit (GPU).
